javascript does not understand html, thought when written as a string i.e using the ``
can be written with.

In react jsx is used, here is another language like javascript but also has the html syntax

in jsx 'class' is a reserved word so it cann't be used oftenly like in the case of html
therefore 'className' is used instead.
