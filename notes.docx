javascript does not understand html, thought when written as a string i.e using the ``
can be written with.

In react jsx is used, here is another language like javascript but also has the html syntax

in jsx 'class' is a reserved word so it cann't be used oftenly like in the case of html
therefore 'className' is used instead.

in react inline styles works different instead of specifying string "background-color: white", it is written in javascript
starting with carly brackets {} the style is written as an object so it is inside another carly brackets
{{backgroundColor="white"}} an object can not have a dash and know the specific color is a string.

in react each elements that is being looped should have a key which is declared with a eunique ID; this is for optimization

when ever we must reload the user interface we need state
